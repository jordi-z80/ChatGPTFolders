# ChatGPTFolders

This is a small test project to learn about Chromium extensions.

The extension basically injects a folder-like structure into ChatGPT's left side that allows you to sort your chats. The original chat list is not altered, at least for the moment.

The icons are changed to know beforehand if your chat is GPT3, GPT4 or web browsing.
